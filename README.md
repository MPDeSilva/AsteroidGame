# AsteroidGame

## Overview
This repository contains my version of the classic Atari game, developed as a university project. The game is built using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. While it's not fully complete and polished to the highest standards, it represents a significant learning experience in game development.

## Learning Outcomes
- **JavaScript**: Gained practical experience in using JavaScript for game logic and dynamic content manipulation.
- **CSS/HTML**: Used for the game's layout and visual elements.
- **Problem-Solving**: Faced and overcame numerous challenges in game development.
- **Limitations**: Learned the importance of time management and realistic goal-setting in project development.

## Reflection
Though the project did not reach the level of completion I initially envisioned, it was a valuable experience. It taught me about the complexities of game development and the importance of iterative learning. I've documented my mistakes and the lessons learned to help guide future projects.

### Note
This project is a learning tool and a stepping stone for further development in game design and web development skills.
